# cifrizal

## Context

Rizal kept a diary during his stay in Spain.
In this diary, he decided to write some parts using a substitution cipher.
Miguel de Unamuno deciphered these in a letter to W. E. Retana, which he cites in his *Vida y escritos*.

### Sources

- [Jose Rizal, suspected spy, deciphered. *Philippine Daily Inquirer*](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/7951/jose-rizal-suspected-spy-deciphered)
- [Segunda época, II. *Vida y escritos del Dr. José Rizal*](https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Vida_y_escritos_del_Dr._José_Rizal/Segunda_época,_II)

The transcriptions of Rizal's diary, or perhaps Rizal's encryption, weren't perfect though.
For example, *Vida y escritos* cites "Consuelo" as "ciphered" as "Vinruati" instead of "Vimruati".
